	<h2> About Me </h2>

	<h3>Education: </h3>

  <p> In Spring of 2024 I completed my Masters in Science and Engineering of Computation at the
  <b lang="es">Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México</b> (National Autonomous University of Mexico, UNAM). under the guidance of 
  <a href="http://turing.iimas.unam.mx/~egarduno/" target="_blank">Dr. Edgar Garduño</a>.
  <br>
  My degree's focus area is Signals, Images, and Virtual Environments. <br>
  I graduated with a GPA of 9.64/10.00.
  </p>
	<p>
	I completed my undergraduate studies at the <b>University of Michigan -- Ann Arbor </b>
	in May of 2021 with a final GPA of 3.40/4.00. Where I majored in Computer Science and minored in Spanish. 

	During this time I had the pleasure of working on a project under the guidance of 
	<a href="https://kjl.name/" target="_blank">Dr. Kevin Leach</a>. Our work involved automatic
	summarization of binary code and the application of such a model for the comprehension of
	unknown malicious binaries.

	</p>

	<p>
	
	In the beginning of 2018 I was awarded an Associates in Science and Arts from <b>Muskegon Community
	College</b> with a GPA of 3.93/4.00. 

	</p>

	<h3>Experience: </h3>

	<p><b> Oracle - Software Developer II </b> <i>June 2023 - Present</i></p>
	<p>
  After completing my internship I was privileged with an offer to work full time as a software
  developer at Oracle Mexico. <br>

  I currently work on Automation Tools on the database stack.
	</p>

	<p><b> Oracle - Internship </b> <i>August 2022 - June 2023</i></p>
	<p>
  From August 2022 to June of the following year I held an internship at the <b> Oracle
    Mexico Development Center</b> in Guadalajara, Mexico. This was a part time remote job
  as I completed my masters at UNAM.

  <br>
  During this time I worked on two teams, the first involved Test Development for JDBC.
  On this team I created a framework to apply RDBMS test suites to Oracle's relatively new
  Autonomous Databases on the cloud.
  <br>
  Following this I spent some time working with Automation Tools as an intern. This was still
  on the side of Database Testing but now I was working on tools to automate tests for other
  developers to make use of. <br>

  The projects realized during this internship allowed me to earn my Masters degree in Science and Engineering of Computation at UNAM. Awarded in Spring of 2024.
	</p>


	<p><b>UNAM - Language Engineering Lab</b> <i>June 2022 - Present</i></p>
	<p>
	I am currently working with <a href="http://www.ii.unam.mx/es-mx/Investigacion/Academicos/Paginas/GBelE.aspx" target="_blank">Dr. Gemma Bel-Enguix</a>
	at UNAM as a research assistant. My main responsabilities are collaborating in writing of Academic Papers, researching related work,
	running experiments, and translating documents from Spanish to English for publication. We are operating under UNAM's 
	<a href=http://grupos.iingen.unam.mx/iling/es-mx/Paginas/default.aspx target="_blank">
	<b lang="es">Grupo Ingeniería Lingüística</b></a> (The Language Engineering Lab). 

	<br>
	Currently my role has been primarily researching and writing articles on datasets we have created
	for the detection of heteronormativity in English and LGBTphobic speech in Mexican Spanish. <a href="publications.html">See publications</a>
	</p>

	<p><b>UMICH - Research Assistant</b><i> August 2019 - August 2021 </i></p>

	<p>
	I worked under Dr. Kevin Leach as a research assistant for the majority of my studies at the University of Michigan.
	Currently, we are still collaborating on projects, but I am no longer formally employed by the University.
	<br>
	I developed a system for the automatic summarization of compiled C code, using NLP models to "translate" sequences of
	assembly instructions into short English summaries. My responsabilities included performing rigorous static analysis on
	assembly code utilizing tools such as Ghidra, Objdump, and Radare2. We trained and fine-tuned neural networks for the summarization
	of code, using models such as BiLSTMs and generative BERT models. We even designed an IRA exempt human study to quantify
	analyst understanding of assembly code. This was my first experience writing for academic publication, but it was very
	enriching and helped me to refine my writing skills and learn a lot about running research experiments.
	<br>
	In addition, I assisted in image processing for a project an object recognition project. We used the <a href="http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/" target="_blank">
		KITTI Vision Benchmark Suite</a> for a data set of drive images. We simulated a car with four cameras by splitting the images into sections,
	and predicting the objects using state-of-the-art neural networks for computer vision, <a href="https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet" target="_blank">YOLOv4</a>.
